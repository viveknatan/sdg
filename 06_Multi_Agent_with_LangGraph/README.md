In today's assignment, we'll be creating a MULTI-Agentic LangGraph Application.

- 🤝 Breakout Room #1:
  1. Simple LCEL RAG
  2. Helper Functions for Agent Graphs
  3. Research Team - A LangGraph for Researching A Specific Topic
  
- 🤝 Breakout Room #2:
  1. Document Writing Team - A LangGraph for Writing, Editing, and Planning a LinkedIn post.
  2. Meta-Supervisor and Full Graph

### 🚧 OPTIONAL: Advanced Build

> NOTE: This is an optional task - and is not required to achieve full marks on the assignment.

Build a graph to produce a social media post about a given Machine Learning paper. 

The graph should employ an additional team that verifies the correctness of the produced paper, and verify it fits the theme and style of your selected social media platform.
